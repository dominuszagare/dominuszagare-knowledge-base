# Language processing

Language processing is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.

### Recreating results from a paper

As a exercise we will try and recreate results from a paper in the field of language processing. With this we will get a better understanding of the field and the tools used in it.

### Some examples of scientific articles:
