## Parallel vs non-parallel corpora

Text Style Transfer algorithms ca be developed in a supervised way, using parallel corpora, i.e a corpus of text in the source language and a corpus of text in the target language. The algorithm is trained to map the source text to the target text. The algorithm can then be used to transfer the style of the target text to the source text.
