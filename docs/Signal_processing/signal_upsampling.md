# Signal upsampling

Upsampling is the process of increasing the sampling rate of a signal. This is
done by inserting zeros between samples. The number of zeros inserted between samples and then applaying a low pass filter to the signal. This will result in a signal with a higher sampling rate. but the signal will be distorted. The number of zeros inserted between samples is called the upsampling factor. The higher the upsampling factor the more the signal will be distorted.
