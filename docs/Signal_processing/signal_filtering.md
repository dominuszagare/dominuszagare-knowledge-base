# Signal filtering

Sometimes to make the data useful we must filter out any undesired noise or signals that are not what we are interested in

## Types of filters

There are many types of filters, but the most common are:

- Low-pass filter
- High-pass filter
- Band-pass filter
- Band-stop filter

## Low-pass filter

A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.

## High-pass filter

A high-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.

## Band-pass filter

A band-pass filter is a filter that passes signals within a certain frequency range and attenuates signals with frequencies outside of that range.

## Band-stop filter

A band-stop filter is a filter that attenuates signals within a certain frequency range and passes signals with frequencies outside of that range.

## Butterworth filter

## Chebyshev filter

## Elliptic filter
