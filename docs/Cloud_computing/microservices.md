# Microservices
 microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposition into small services is that it improves modularity. The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

## Why use microservices

Microservices are a way to break down a large application into smaller, more manageable pieces. This is done by splitting the application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Each service is a self-contained unit that can be deployed and scaled independently. This allows for faster development, easier maintenance, and the ability to scale each service independently.
