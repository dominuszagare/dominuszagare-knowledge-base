# Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

## Gathering data with a mobile phone

The mobile phone is a device that can be used to gather data. The data can be gathered by using the phone's sensors. The sensors can be used to gather data about the environment. The data can be used to create a model of the environment. The model can be used to predict the behavior of the environment.

### Exercise goals

- Find a innovative wat to use the mobile phone to gather data about the environment.

### Presentation

Present the idea in a 5 minute presentation.
- What kind of sensors did you use?
- What kind of data did you gather?
- Describe the hypothesis.
- Describe the experiments.
- What kind of data did you gather?
- Analyze the data.and confirm or reject the hypothesis.

### Application

- Enable entering data
- Data must be described with metadata
- Data must be stored and accessible
- Data must be visualized

### Idea

### Sensors

- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer

### Data

- Acceleration
- Angular velocity
