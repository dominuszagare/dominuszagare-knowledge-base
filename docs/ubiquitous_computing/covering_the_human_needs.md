# Covering human needs

Computers have enormous potential to make the world a better place. They can help us solve problems, make our lives easier, and make the world a better place. But to do that they need to be designed to cover human needs.

## For what purpose?

If you are thinking of a product to solve a problem you should ask yourself why should yo make it and the answer is: because I can. I have the technology, i have the resources, and the will. I can do it, and I should do it. That is not what you should be thinking. You should be thinking about if people really want your product and what problems does it solve? You should also think on the implications of your product on society and on how can it make the world a better place?

When asking people for opinion don't ask them if they think your product is good. Ask them what every day problems they have. Then you can start to design your product to solve those problems. You can also ask them what they would like to see in the future.

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation". Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a pyramid that contains five levels of needs. The lower levels of the pyramid are the most basic needs, and the higher levels are the more advanced needs. The five levels of needs are:

1. Physiological needs
2. Safety needs
3. Belongingness and love needs
4. Esteem needs
5. Self-actualization needs

#### 1. Physiological needs

Physiological needs are the most basic needs. They are the needs that are required for survival. They include the need for food, water, shelter, and sleep.

#### 2. Safety needs

Safety needs are the needs that are required for safety. They include the need for security, order, law, stability, and freedom from fear.

#### 3. Belongingness and love needs

### Alderfer's ERG theory

Alderfer's ERG theory is a theory in psychology proposed by Clayton Alderfer in his 1969 paper "An Empirical Test of a New Theory of Human Needs". Alderfer's ERG theory is a pyramid that contains three levels of needs. The lower levels of the pyramid are the most basic needs, and the higher levels are the more advanced needs. The three levels of needs are:

1. Existence needs (Masslow's 1. and 2.)
2. Relatedness needs (Masslow's 3. and 4.)
3. Growth needs (Masslow's 5.)

#### Existence needs

Existence needs are the most basic needs. They are the needs that are required for survival. They include the need for food, water, shelter, and sleep.

#### Relatedness needs

Relatedness needs are the needs that are required for social interaction. They include the need for friendship, intimacy, and family.

#### Growth needs

Growth needs are the needs that are required for personal growth. They include the need for self-fulfillment, seeking personal potential, and self-actualization.

## The Apollonian and Dionysian

The Apollonian and Dionysian are two opposing forces in Greek mythology. They are the forces that are in conflict with each other. They are the forces that are in balance with each other. They are the forces that are in harmony with each other.

They are also terms used by Friedrich Nietzsche in his book The Birth of Tragedy, from 1872, where he explores the tension between those two opposing forces in art, but that could be applied to life.

Apollonian values are grounded in logical thought and its adherents strive to develop clear, rational philosophy which seeks to bring meaning and understanding to lifeâ€™s complexities. Nietzsche argued that by relying solely on the Apollonian aspects of ourselves we can become too rigid in our thinking and fail to take into account the subjective views offered by our emotions.

On the other hand, Dionysian values embrace chaos, passion, emotion, and pleasure as essential parts of life. Nietzsche believed that by embracing these wilder sides of ourselves, we could achieve an authentic connection with our true nature, ultimately leading us closer to enlightenment. Nietzsche argued that we must be open-minded enough to explore different perspectives, even if they go against conventional wisdom or accepted beliefs.
