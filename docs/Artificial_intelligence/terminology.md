# Terminology

This page contains a list of terms used in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Classification

Classification is a process of assigning a label to a data point. The label can be a class or a category. The goal of classification is to predict the label of a data point based on the labels of similar data points.

## Regression

Regression is a process of predicting a continuous value. The goal of regression is to predict the value of a data point based on the values of similar data points.

## Activation function

An activation function is a mathematical function that is applied to the output of a neuron. The activation function transforms the output of a neuron into an output that can be used by the next layer of neurons.

## Nural network

A neural network is a network of neurons. A neuron is a mathematical function that takes in a number of inputs and produces an output. The output of a neuron is a function of the inputs and the weights of the connections between the neurons. The weights are adjusted during training to produce the desired output.
