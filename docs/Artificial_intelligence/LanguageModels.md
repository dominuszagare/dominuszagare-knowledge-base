# Transformer models

## Introduction

Transformer models are a class of models that have been proven to be very effective in many NLP tasks. They are based on the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when predicting the output. They have been shown to outperform recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in many tasks.
