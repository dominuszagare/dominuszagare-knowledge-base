[Von Neuman computer Architecture](https://www.mpoweruk.com/computer_architecture.htm)

The basic building blocks of a stored program digital computer were defined around 1945 by Eckert and Mauchly based on their experience with their ENIAC computer, started in 1943 and completed in 1946, and used in the construction of their 1952 EDVAC stored program computer. A description of how these blocks were interconnected and how they functioned together was published in a progress report in 1945 by mathematician [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) who worked on the project. This arrangement subsequently became known as the von Neumann architecture and is the basis of most general purpose digital computers today.

1. The CPU fetches program instructions from memory in time with the clock
Faster the clock faster the execution of instructions.
2. Result of each instruction is then saved back into memory.

memory's only job isn't only storing values and instructions. It can also interface with **input** and **output** devices. Where the input devices effect the value in memory and memory effect the state of output devices.
