# Tree pruning

Pruning is the process of removing branches from a tree. This is done to improve the health of the tree, to improve the quality of the fruit, and to improve the yield of the tree. Pruning is also done to improve the appearance of the tree. The primary reason for trimming trees is to ensure the most optimal access to sunlight. Pruning allows for aeration, allowing light channels to penetrate the tree, allowing a better fruit set, ease of harvest, and the ability to battle or thwart disease.

## When to prune

Pruning should be done in the winter, when the tree is dormant. This is because the tree is not actively growing, and the wounds will heal faster.

## How to prune

Pruning is done by cutting the branch at the point where you want to remove it. The cut should be made at a 45 degree angle, and should be made just outside of a bud. This will allow the tree to heal the wound, and will allow the tree to grow new branches from the bud.

## Types of pruning

There are two types of pruning: thinning and heading. Thinning is the process of removing branches from the tree. Heading is the process of removing the top of the tree.
