## What is big data?

### 5 V's of big data

Big data is characterized by the 5 V's:
1. Volume
2. Velocity
3. Variety
4. Veracity
5. Value

#### Volume

Volume refers to the size of the data set. Big data is often characterized by a large volume of data. The volume of data can be measured in terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, zettabytes, yottabytes, etc.

#### Velocity

Velocity refers to the speed at which the data is generated. Big data is often characterized by a high velocity of data. The velocity of data can be measured in megabytes per second, gigabytes per second, terabytes per second, etc.

#### Variety

Variety refers to the different types of data. Big data is often characterized by a large variety of data. The variety of data can be measured in the number of different data types.

#### Veracity

Veracity refers to the quality of the data. Big data is often characterized by a low veracity of data. The veracity of data can be measured in the number of errors in the data.

#### Value

Value refers to the usefulness of the data. Big data is often characterized by a high value of data. The value of data can be measured in the number of useful insights that can be extracted from the data.
