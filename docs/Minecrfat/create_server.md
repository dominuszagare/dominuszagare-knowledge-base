# Running the game

Minecarft is writen in Java and runs on a Java virtual machine on broad range of devices and operating systems. Thats why you need to install [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) on your machine before you can launch Minecraft-Java-edition.

## Minecraft servers

There are a plenty of different Minecraft servers available for use. 
From the default one provided by Mojang to other community created ones like Paper Spigot, ...

- [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) (Performance oriented supports Bukkit and Spigot plugins)
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/server/) (for modded Minecraft based on fabric API)
- [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) (for modded Minecraft based on forge API)
- [Default](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) server provided by Mojang

## Plugins and datapacks

[Plugins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins) and [datapacks](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-packs/) can help augment the game on the server without the user having to install anything on their end. They enable us to completely change how the game plays or provide tools for admins to manage the server.

Datapacks can also be used to enrich singleplayer experiences.
here are some other useful links:
- [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)

## Mods

Mods can also be used to change how the game plays. But for them to work on multiplayer server everyone must have them installed on their clients. There are to mayor modloaders when loading mods on servers and clients. [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/).

- [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods)
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods)

## Why not Mods + Plugins

There are some incompatibilities when using mods and plugins so when creating a server is eater one or the other

## Minecraft clients

To lunch minecraft you usually use a client to manage your game versions, accounts, mods and more. There are also many different clients available to use. My favorite is simple but powerful multiMC luncher, that allows easy managing of game versions, mods, and user accounts, you can even export packages for all of your friends to setup the same game version and mods on all of their computers if they are using the multiMC luncher

- [CurseForge Launcher](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/)
- [SKLauncher](https://skmedix.pl/)
- [TLauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/)
- [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/)
- [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads)
- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/)

There are also clients for people that didn't pay for their Minecraft accounts those can use the following luncher as they don't require a account to launch the game.

- [Titan Launcher](https://titan.mythicmc.org/)
- [Launcher Fénix](https://launcherfenix.com.ar/wope/)

Whenever you find a launcher that refers to itself as “No-Premium,” it means that you can still access and play the game even if you don’t have a Mojang or Microsoft account. 

Using a No-Premium launcher without actually owning an original copy can be interpreted as an active piracy endorsement and violates Mojang's terms and conditions. 

On the topic of unendorsed behavior your can not only mood the game to add new content but to also cheat using [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/) or [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone). Both are tools allowing to automate the player actions or see information that would be otherwise be hidden. This is often seen as cheating as it can also give you a unfair advantage over other players.

Baritone and Wurst are great tool but refrain using them on multiplayer servers because they can ruin the experience for other people.
