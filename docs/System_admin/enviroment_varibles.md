## Windows
[Seting enviroment varibles on windows](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Environment_Variables.html)
Environment Variables in Windows are NOT case-sensitive (because the legacy DOS is NOT case-sensitive). They are typically named in uppercase, with words joined with underscore (_), e.g., JAVA_HOME.
```
set
COMPUTERNAME=xxxxxxx
OS=xxxxxxx
```

**echo %PATH%** (print out the variable value)
